Starting from 2009, each year I participate in the "Systems biology, genomics and bioinformatics" master 2 course, with 3 hour short course
on data integration in cancer research and systems biology of cancer. I introduce types of data analyzed in cancer research, give
examples of multi-omics data analysis, explain, based on real projects, application of some machine learning techniques 
(such as Independent Component Analysis) to omics data.
