In 2016 and 2017 I was a co-organizer and lecturer of 80 hours teaching module "Mathematical Modeling of Biological Systems" 
as a part of the pre-doctoral training program at <a href="https://collegedoctoral.psl.eu/en/psl-doctorate/psl-iti-program/">PSL-ITI</a>.
The course covered a wide range of topics related to application of mathematical modeling (in wide sense) to understand biology.
My lectures in the course were devoted to application of machine learning in cancer research. In 2018, I organized a limited
edition of this module, with only few lectures.
