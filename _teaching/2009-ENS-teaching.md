Starting from 2009, each year I participate in the <a href="https://www.enseignement.biologie.ens.fr/spip.php?article190">Systems biology, genomics and bioinformatics</a> 
master 2 module at <a href="http://www.ens.fr/">ENS</a>, with 3 hours mini-course on data integration in cancer research and systems biology of cancer. 
I introduce types of data analyzed in cancer research, give examples of multi-omics data analysis, explain, based on real projects, application of some machine learning techniques to omics data.
