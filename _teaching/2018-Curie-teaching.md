I co-organize and give lectures at yearly <a href="https://training.institut-curie.org/courses/sysbiocancer2019">International Curie Course on Computational Systems Biology of Cancer</a>.
In 2018, I gave 1 hour lecture on application of machine learning for characterizing tumor microenvironment.
The 2019 edition of International Curie course on computational biology will be devoted to single-cell data analysis.
The 2020 edition of International Curie course will focus on application of machine learning and artificial intelligence
in biology of cancer.
