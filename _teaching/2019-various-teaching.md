I constantly participate as invited lecturer in multiple teaching courses and summer school organized worldwide.
For example, I participated in the thematic school <a href="http://carpem.fr/agt-2015/">Analysis of Cancer genome</a> (2015)
and in the <a href="https://www.france-bioinformatique.fr/fr/evenements/genopole-summer-school-2018">Genopole Summer School</a> 
on Bioinformatic and Biostatistic tools in medical genomics in 2018.
My topics are various, including data visualization, machine learning for biomedical applications, mathematical modeling
in biology and others.
