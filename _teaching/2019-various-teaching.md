I constantly participate as invited lecturer in courses and summer schools organized worldwide.
For example, I participated in the thematic school <a href="http://carpem.fr/agt-2015/">Analysis of Cancer genome</a> (2015)
and in the <a href="https://www.france-bioinformatique.fr/fr/evenements/genopole-summer-school-2018">Genopole Summer School</a> 
on Bioinformatic and Biostatistic tools in medical genomics in 2018.
My topics are various, including data visualization, some aspects of machine learning for biomedical applications, 
mathematical modeling in biology and introductory lectures into systems biology and cancer bioinformatics.
