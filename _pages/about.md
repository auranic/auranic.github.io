I am a permanent senior researcher working in bioinformatics and systems biology at <a href="http://curie.fr">Institut Curie</a> since 2005.
I co-lead and coordinate scientific projects of <a href="http://sysbio.curie.fr">Computational Systems Biology of Cancer</a> team
inside <a href="https://science.institut-curie.org/research/integrated-biology/bioinformatics-biostatistics-epidemiology-and-computational-systems-biology-of-cancer/">Bioinformatics of Cancer department</a>.
My university education was in theoretical physics (cosmology). Afterwards I made my russian PhD in computer science:
namely, I developed a computationally effective method for constructing non-linear principal manifolds from the data.
After spending 3 years as a post-doc in a French analogue of Institut of Advanced Studies, <a href="http://www.ihes.fr">Institut des Hautes Études Scientifiques (IHES)</a>,
I got a permanent researcher position at <a href="http://curie.fr">Institut Curie</a> with a mission to participate in building and defining
the strategy of a new systems biology research group.

Computational Systems Biology of Cancer
------

Together with my group, I was involved in a number of projects on application of systems biology approach to
improve understanding of cancer progression and rationalize cancer treatment.
To answer questions for which no computational tools were available, we developed a number of 
open source software packages.


Methods of Machine Learning and AI
------

Over the past 20 years, I've been developing new and improve existing methods of machine learning
aimed at tackling the complexity of multi-dimensional data point clouds.
In collaboration with my long-term collaborators from <a href="https://www2.le.ac.uk/centres/mmc">University of Leicester</a> 
we develop scalable tools for robust dimensionality reduction, applicable for data distributions
characterized by non-trivial complex structure and organization. One of the major applications
of these mathematical tools today is for dealing with data coming from single-cell sequencing
technology application.
