I am a permanent senior researcher working in bioinformatics and systems biology at <a href="http://curie.fr">Institut Curie</a> since 2005.
I co-lead and coordinate scientific projects of <a href="http://sysbio.curie.fr">Computational Systems Biology of Cancer</a> team
inside <a href="https://science.institut-curie.org/research/integrated-biology/bioinformatics-biostatistics-epidemiology-and-computational-systems-biology-of-cancer/">Bioinformatics of Cancer department</a>.
My university education was in theoretical physics (cosmology). Afterwards I made my russian PhD in computer science:
namely, I developed a computationally effective method for constructing non-linear principal manifolds from the data.
After spending 3 years as a post-doc in a French analogue of Institut of Advanced Studies, <a href="http://www.ihes.fr">Institut des Hautes Études Scientifiques (IHES)</a>,
I got a permanent researcher position at <a href="http://curie.fr">Institut Curie</a> with a mission to participate in building and defining
the strategy of a new systems biology research group.
