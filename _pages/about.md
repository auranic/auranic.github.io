I am a permanent senior researcher working in bioinformatics and systems biology at <a href="http://curie.fr">Institut Curie</a> since 2005.
I co-lead and coordinate scientific projects of <a href="http://sysbio.curie.fr">Computational Systems Biology of Cancer</a> team
inside <a href="https://science.institut-curie.org/research/integrated-biology/bioinformatics-biostatistics-epidemiology-and-computational-systems-biology-of-cancer/">Bioinformatics of Cancer department</a>.
My university education was in theoretical physics (cosmology). Afterwards I made my russian PhD in computer science:
namely, I developed a computationally effective method for constructing non-linear principal manifolds from the data.
After spending 3 years as a post-doc in a French analogue of Institut of Advanced Studies, <a href="http://www.ihes.fr">Institut des Hautes Études Scientifiques (IHES)</a>,
I got a permanent researcher position at <a href="http://curie.fr">Institut Curie</a> with a mission to participate in building and defining
the strategy of a new systems biology research group.

Computational Systems Biology of Cancer
------

Together with my group, I was involved in a number of projects on application of systems biology approach to
improve understanding of cancer progression and rationalize cancer treatment.
The problem-driven strategy which underlines the construction of projects of our group combines
data-driven, model-driven and network-based approaches. 

I have expertise in development of commercial software:
therefore, the members of the group created a number of packaged tools used by the systems biology community.


Methods of Machine Learning and AI
------

Over the past 20 years, I develop new and improve existing methods of machine learning
aimed at tackling the multi-level complexity of multi-dimensional data point clouds.
In collaboration with experts from <a href="https://www2.le.ac.uk/centres/mmc">University of Leicester</a> 
and <a href="http://pinellolab.org/">Harvard Medical School</a>, we develop scalable tools 
for robust dimensionality reduction, applicable for data distributions
characterized by non-trivial complex structure and organization. One of the major applications
of these mathematical tools today is for dealing with results of single-cell sequencing
technology application.
