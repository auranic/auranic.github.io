I am a permanent senior researcher working at the <a href="http://www.curie.fr">Institut Curie</a> since 2005.

I co-lead and coordinate scientific projects of <a href="http://sysbio.curie.fr">Computational Systems Biology of Cancer</a> team 
inside <a href="https://science.institut-curie.org/research/integrated-biology/bioinformatics-biostatistics-epidemiology-and-computational-systems-biology-of-cancer/">Bioinformatics of Cancer department</a>.

My university education was in theoretical physics (cosmology, models of closed Universe with conformal metrics). 
I did my PhD in computer science on the subject of developing a computationally effective method 
of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elastic_map">elastic maps</a> for constructing non-linear principal manifolds 
by suggesting an optimization-based generalisation of self-organizing maps.
After spending 3 years of post-doc in the French analogue of Advanced Studies Institute, <a href="http://www.ihes.fr">Institut des Hautes Etudes Scientifiques (IHES)</a>,
I got a permanent researcher position at <a href="http://curie.fr">Institut Curie</a> with a mission to participate in building and defining
strategy of a new systems biology research group.

I co-author around 90 peer-reviewed pubications, 3 books and 15 book chapters. 
I (co-)supervised 8 PhD students.
I am an active scientific software developer.
I have rich experience of scientific and industrial collaborations. 
I teach short courses on data integration and application of machine learning in cancer research. 
I constantly participate in organization of courses, workshops and conferences.


Computational Systems Biology of Cancer
------

Together with my group, I was involved in <a href="https://sysbio.curie.fr/projects.html">tens of small and large projects</a> 
on application of systems biology approach to improve understanding of cancer progression and rationalize cancer treatment.
We gained internationally recognized expertise in modeling biological networks, 
application of machine learning to cancer omics data and formalization of biological knowledge.
Together we've developed <a href="https://sysbio.curie.fr/software.html">many open source software packages</a> for systems biology and biological data analysis,
widely used by the academic community.


Methodology of machine learning and artifical intelligence
------

Over the past 20 years, I've been developing new and improving existing methods of machine learning
aimed at quantifying the complexity of multi-dimensional data point clouds.
In collaboration with my long-term collaborators from <a href="https://www2.le.ac.uk/centres/mmc">University of Leicester</a> 
we develop scalable tools for robust dimensionality reduction, applicable for data distributions
characterized by non-trivial complex structure and organization. 
We introduced methods of <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0893965906001856">topological graph grammars</a> and 
<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/271642170_Principal_Manifolds_for_Data_Visualisation_and_Dimension_Reduction_LNCSE_58">elastic principal trees and graphs</a>.
Based on ideas from tropical mathematics, we develop a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0893608016301113">theory of piece-wise quadratic function approximation and optimization</a> which allows making many of existing machine learning methods faster and more robust to noise.
We developed <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.06328">effective dimension estimates</a> based on data point separability properties. We study
the phenomenon of <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rsta.2017.0237">"blessing of dimensionality"</a> for truely high-dimensional data distributions, and how it can be
exploited for correcting legacy artificial intelligence systems in real-life applications.
One of the major applications of these mathematical tools today is for dealing with large-scale data coming from single-cell sequencing
technology application.


Dealing with complexity of biological systems through mathematical modeling
------

I have an extensive experience and long-term interest to the mechanistical modeling
of biological systems. My special interest is how one can create realistic
dynamic models of large biochemical networks.
I have long-term interest in model reduction (reducing complexity of mathematical models).
With my group, we pioneered application of discrete (Boolean) 
modeling to cancer biology.
