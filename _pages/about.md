I am a permanent senior researcher working in bioinformatics and systems biology at Institut Curie since 2005.

I co-lead and coordinate scientific projects of Computational Systems Biology of Cancer team inside Bioinformatics of Cancer department.

My university education was in theoretical physics (cosmology). Afterwards I made my russian PhD in computer science:
namely, I developed a computationally effective method for constructing non-linear principal manifolds from the data.
After spending 3 years as a post-doc in a French analogue of Institut of Advanced Studies, <a href="http://www.ihes.fr">Institut des Hautes Études Scientifiques (IHES)</a>,
I got a permanent researcher position at <a href="http://curie.fr">Institut Curie</a> with a mission to participate in building and defining
the strategy of a new systems biology research group.


Computational Systems Biology of Cancer
------

Together with my group, I was involved in a number of projects on application of systems biology approach to
improve understanding of cancer progression and rationalize cancer treatment.
With my group, we developed a number of open source software packages for systems biology community.


Methods of Machine Learning and AI
------

Over the past 20 years, I've been developing new and improving existing methods of machine learning
aimed at tackling the complexity of multi-dimensional data point clouds.
In collaboration with my long-term collaborators from <a href="https://www2.le.ac.uk/centres/mmc">University of Leicester</a> 
we develop scalable tools for robust dimensionality reduction, applicable for data distributions
characterized by non-trivial complex structure and organization. One of the major applications
of these mathematical tools today is for dealing with data coming from single-cell sequencing
technology application.
