I am a permanent senior researcher working in bioinformatics and systems biology at Institut Curie since 2005.

I co-lead and coordinate scientific projects of Computational Systems Biology of Cancer team inside Bioinformatics of Cancer department.

My university education was in theoretical physics (cosmology). Afterwards I made my PhD in computer science:
I developed a computationally effective method for constructing non-linear principal manifolds.
After spending 3 years as a post-doc in a French analogue of Institut of Advanced Studies, <a href="http://www.ihes.fr">Institut des Hautes Etudes Scientifiques (IHES)</a>,
I got a permanent researcher position at <a href="http://curie.fr">Institut Curie</a> with a mission to participate in building and defining
the strategy of a new systems biology research group.

I author around 90 peer-reviewed pubications, 3 books and 15 book chapters. 
I am an active scientific software developer.
I have experience of numerous scientific and industrial collaborations. 
I teach short courses on data integration and exploratory machine learning in cancer research. 
I participated in organization of a number of scientific courses, workshops and conferences.


Computational Systems Biology of Cancer
------

Together with my group, I was involved in a number of projects on application of systems biology approach to
improve understanding of cancer progression and rationalize cancer treatment.
With my group, we developed many open source software packages for systems biology and biological data analysis,
widely used by the academic community.


Methods of Machine Learning and AI
------

Over the past 20 years, I've been developing new and improving existing methods of machine learning
aimed at quantifying the complexity of multi-dimensional data point clouds.
In collaboration with my long-term collaborators from <a href="https://www2.le.ac.uk/centres/mmc">University of Leicester</a> 
we develop scalable tools for robust dimensionality reduction, applicable for data distributions
characterized by non-trivial complex structure and organization. One of the major applications
of these mathematical tools today is for dealing with data coming from single-cell sequencing
technology application.


Dealing with complexity of biological systems through mathematical modeling
------

I have an extensive experience and long-term interest to the mechanistical modeling
of biological systems. My special interest is how one can create realistic
dynamic models of large biochemical networks.
With my group, we pioneered application of discrete (Boolean) 
modeling to cancer biology.
