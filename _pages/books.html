<font color=#400000><i>Book chapter in <a href="http://www.igi-global.com/reference/details.asp?ID=34664">"Handbook of Research on Machine Learning Applications and Trends: Algorithms, Methods and Techniques"</a> (eds. Olivas E.S., Guererro J.D.M.,

<small>This chapter gives a brief practical introduction into the methods of construction of general
principal objects (i.e., objects embedded in the ‘middle’ of the multidimensional data set). As a basis,
the unifying framework of mean squared distance approximation of finite datasets is selected. Principal
graphs and manifolds are constructed as generalisations of principal components and k-means principal
points. For this purpose, the family of expectation/maximisation algorithms with nearest generalisations
is presented. Construction of principal graphs with controlled complexity is based on the graph
grammar approach</small>

<font size="3"><b>Principal Manifolds for Data Visualization and Dimension Reduction  (Alexander Gorban, Balázs Kégl, Donald Wunch, Andrei Zinovyev (eds.))
(<a href="http://www.amazon.ca/Principal-Manifolds-Visualization-Dimension-Reduction/dp/3540737499">Amazon link</a>, whole book <a href="http://pca.narod.ru/contentsgkwz.htm">text</a>)</b></font>

In 1901, Karl Pearson invented Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Since then, PCA serves as a prototype for many other tools of data analysis, visualization and dimension reduction: Independent Component Analysis (ICA), Multidimensional Scaling (MDS), Nonlinear PCA (NLPCA), Self Organizing Maps (SOM), etc. The book starts with the quote of the classical Pearson definition of PCA and includes reviews of various methods: NLPCA, ICA, MDS, embedding and clustering algorithms, principal manifolds and SOM. New approaches to NLPCA, principal manifolds, branching principal components and topology preserving mappings are described as well. Presentation of algorithms is supplemented by case studies, from engineering to astronomy, but mostly of biological data: analysis of microarray and metabolite data. The volume ends with a tutorial "PCA and K-means decipher genome". The book is meant to be useful for practitioners in applied data analysis in life sciences, engineering, physics and chemistry; it will also be valuable to PhD students and researchers in computer sciences, applied mathematics and statistics.
